Result and Conclusion:
 In Smart Trolley System, now there is no need for the customers to wait in the queue and wait for his/her turn for the scanning of the product items. Especially during weekends or festivals season, there is not time wastage in waiting in the queue. The customer has to do only billing at the billing counter and only those customers can use the smart trolley who are having membership card where RFID Tag is inserted in it. So, supermarkets or hypermarkets use this concept as their business strategy to attract more number of customers. Future Scope We have to update the details of the product items in the memory unit of trolley time to time. We take the help of Internet of Things and some software with the help of which all information will be updated regularly. Also, with the help of optical sensor, motors, and motor drivers, we will make trolley in such a way that it will follow the customer which purchasing items and it maintains the safe distance between customer and itself.
