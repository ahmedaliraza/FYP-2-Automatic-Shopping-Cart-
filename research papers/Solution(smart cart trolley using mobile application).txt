Conclusion: 
 
Experience with Smart Shopping has indicated that there are many technical challenges will be met in deploying a pervasive retail system.Technologies that capture information about interactions between physical products are not yet mature enough for the consumer market as they are relatively costly. Even when such data is available the task of interpreting it is often as challenging as its registration, since no standardized classification scheme or appropriate taxonomy exists. Several efforts to create standards are underway but are still at least years away. Although in the relatively controlled environment of the smart shopping trolley project it has been possible to address this problem on a wireless basis it is hard to envision a situation where widely deployed retail services can operate without such standards. A related problem is that new systems must be integrated in existing retail infrastructures, which often operate using legacy and incompatible systems. Moreover, the deployment of retail causes significant growth in electronic transaction loads which current systems are unable to cope with. Like smart shopping should be available on whatever device consumers have at hand. Although considerable advances have been made in this area, developing and maintaining such applications is still a major challenge.
